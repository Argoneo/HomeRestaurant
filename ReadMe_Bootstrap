- My process
    - HTML5 (semantic, accessible structure)
    - CSS3 with media queries and custom theming
    - Bootstrap 5.3.5 (customized and overridden)
    - Bootstrap Icons
    - JavaScript (for carousel and Bootstrap interactivity)
    - Custom UI/UX: layout, colors, fonts, carousel, responsiveness and images all q modified from original Bootstrap examples

- What I learned
    - This project allowed me to:
        - Start from an existing Bootstrap template and transform it into a completely personalized product
        - Customize deeply Bootstrap components and override default behaviors
        - Improve responsive layout structuring with flex/grid and media queries
        - Create a more engaging UX through background management, custom hover states, mobile-first refinements, and brand-aligned design
        -Refine visual hierarchy and spacing for both mobile and desktop interfaces
